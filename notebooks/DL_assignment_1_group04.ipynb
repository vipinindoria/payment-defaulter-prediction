        "# 1. Problem Statement\n",
        " \n",
        "A default on a credit card is when a cardholder fails to make the required minimum payment on their credit card bill. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as a loss of income or unexpected expenses.\n",
        " \n",
        "   1. What is the problem that you are trying to solve?\n",
        "      - The problem statement of default of credit card clients is to predict which clients are likely to default on their credit card payments based on their historical data and other relevant factors. This is a common problem in the credit industry, as defaulting on credit card payments can lead to significant losses for credit card companies.\n",
        "      - To address this problem, credit card companies can use machine learning algorithms, such as feed forward neural networks, to analyze data on their clients and make predictions about which ones are at risk of defaulting on their payments. This can help credit card companies identify clients who are at high risk of default and take appropriate action to prevent or mitigate that risk.\n",
        "      - Overall, the goal of addressing this problem is to improve the financial health of credit card companies by reducing their exposure to default risk and helping them make more informed decisions about which clients to lend to.\n",
        "   2. What kind of prediction (classification / regression) task are you performing?\n",
        "      - The prediction task for default of credit card clients is a classification task. In a classification task, the goal is to predict which of a set of predefined classes a given input belongs to. In this case, the classes would be \"default\" and \"non-default,\" and the input would be data on a credit card client, such as their payment history and credit score.\n",
        "      - The feed forward neural network would use this data to predict whether the client is likely to default on their payments or not. This would involve training the network on a large dataset of credit card clients, where the labels for each client are either \"default\" or \"non-default.\" The network would learn to recognize patterns and correlations in the data that can help it make accurate predictions about which clients are likely to default.\n",
        "      - Once the network has been trained, we can input new data on credit card clients and use the network to predict whether they are likely to default on their payments or not. This prediction would be a classification, as it would assign each client to one of the predefined classes of \"default\" or \"non-default.\""

        "**Optimizer:** Adam is a popular choice for training machine learning models, including those used for credit default prediction. There are a few reasons why Adam might be a good choice for this type of task:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Efficiency: Adam is generally faster and more computationally efficient than other optimizers, especially for tasks with a large number of parameters. This can be particularly important for credit default prediction models, which may involve large and complex datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Adaptive learning rate: As mentioned earlier, one key advantage of Adam is that it automatically adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on the historical gradient information. This can help to avoid the issue of the learning rate becoming too large or too small, which can lead to slow convergence or instability in the optimization process.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Momentum: Adam includes momentum, which helps the optimizer to continue moving in the right direction even if it encounters a shallow or flat region in the loss function. This can help to speed up convergence and improve the final solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Robustness: Adam has been found to be relatively robust to the choice of hyperparameter values, which means that it may require less fine-tuning compared to other optimizers. This can be particularly useful when working with complex models or datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, Adam is a well-established and effective optimization algorithm that can be a good choice for credit default prediction models. It is important to note, however, that the choice of optimizer should always be based on the specific characteristics of the data and the task being performed, and other optimizers may be more suitable for certain types of models or tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hyperparameter tuning:** The process of hyperparameter tuning involves adjusting the values of certain parameters in the model to optimize its performance. This can involve choosing the optimal values for hyperparameters such as number of hidden layer, activation function, epochs, batch size, the learning rate, the weight decay coefficient, and the dropout rate. The specific values chosen will depend on the characteristics of the data and the task being performed, as well as the complexity of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "A feedforward neural network with three hidden layers and the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function can be a good choice for many types of machine learning tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "The number of hidden layers in a neural network can influence its capacity to learn and represent complex patterns in the data. A deeper network with more hidden layers may be able to learn more complex patterns, but it may also be more prone to overfitting and require more training data. A shallower network with fewer hidden layers may be less prone to overfitting, but it may also have a lower capacity to learn complex patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "The ReLU activation function is a popular choice for many types of neural networks. It allows the network to learn non-linear relationships in the data, which can be important for many tasks. ReLU is also computationally efficient and easy to implement, making it a good choice for many types of models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, a feedforward neural network with three hidden layers and the ReLU activation function can be a good choice for many types of machine learning tasks, but the specific choice of architecture will depend on the characteristics of the data and the task being performed. It may be necessary to experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to find the combination that works best for your particular problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "The number of epochs and the batch size are two important hyperparameters that can affect the performance of a feedforward neural network.\n",
        "\n",
        "The number of epochs refers to the number of times that the entire dataset is passed through the network during training. Increasing the number of epochs can allow the model to continue learning and potentially improve its performance, but it also increases the training time. Choosing an appropriate number of epochs is a trade-off between model performance and training time.\n",
        "\n",
        "The batch size is the number of samples that are processed by the network at a time. A larger batch size can potentially lead to faster training, but it can also increase the memory requirements of the model. A smaller batch size can lead to slower training, but it can also provide a more stable estimate of the gradient, which can improve the model's performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "In general, the optimal values for the number of epochs and batch size will depend on the specific characteristics of the data and the task being performed, as well as the complexity of the model. It is generally a good idea to experiment with different values to find the combination that works best for your particular problem."

        "The problem statement of default of credit card clients is to predict which clients are likely to default on their credit card payments based on their historical data and other relevant factors.

        "A feedforward neural network is a type of artificial neural network that consists of layers of interconnected nodes, with each layer receiving input from the previous layer and sending output to the next layer. These networks are called \"feedforward\" because the information flows through the network in a single direction, from the input layer to the output layer, without looping back.\n",
        "\n",
        "One possible approach to credit default prediction using a feedforward neural network would be to train the network on a dataset of credit default data, such as information about the creditworthiness of individual borrowers or the financial performance of companies. The input to the network could include various features such as the borrower's credit score, income, and debt-to-income ratio, as well as the borrower's history of paying back loans. The output of the network would be a prediction of the likelihood that the borrower will default on a loan.\n",

        "To train the network, we would need to have a labeled dataset with a large number of examples of credit defaults and non-defaults, along with the relevant features for each example. We would then use an optimization algorithm, such as gradient descent, to adjust the weights and biases of the network in order to minimize the error between the predicted output and the true labels in the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the network is trained, we can use it to make predictions on new data by feeding the relevant features into the input layer and using the output layer to produce a prediction of the likelihood of default.\n",
        "\n",
        "To predict credit default using a feedforward neural network, we would first need to gather and prepare a dataset of credit default data. This might involve collecting information about the creditworthiness of individual borrowers or the financial performance of companies, as well as any other relevant features such as the borrower's credit score, income, and debt-to-income ratio. It is also important to have a balanced dataset, with a sufficient number of examples of both credit defaults and non-defaults.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once we have our dataset, we can begin training a feedforward neural network to predict credit default. Some of the challenges we have encountered while working on this problem include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Dealing with missing or incomplete data: It is not uncommon for credit default datasets to have missing or incomplete data, which can make it difficult to train a accurate model. We had to perform data cleaning in order to make the data more suitable for training.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Choosing the appropriate network architecture: There are many different ways to design a feedforward neural network, and the most effective architecture will depend on the specific characteristics of the data and the requirements of the application. We had to experiment with different architectures and evaluate their performance in order to find the best one.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Optimizing the training process: To get the best results from our feedforward neural network, we had to tune the hyperparameters and optimize the training process. This involved selecting the appropriate optimization algorithm, setting the learning rate, and choosing the appropriate batch size.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Evaluating the model's performance: After training the model, it is important to evaluate its performance on a separate test dataset in order to get a sense of how well it will generalize to new data. We have used metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to assess the model's performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "By working through these challenges and making decisions based on our observations and analysis of the data, we have developed a feedforward neural network that is effective at predicting credit default."
